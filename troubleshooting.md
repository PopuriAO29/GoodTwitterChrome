For other issues check known issues below or [submit a new issue](https://github.com/ZusorCode/GoodTwitterChrome/issues).

First, try hard refreshing twitter. Shift+Click on [reload](https://i.imgur.com/b6wAyvY.png) in the twitter tab.

If that didn't work, try reinstalling goodtwitter by going to the [store page](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goodtwitter/jbanhionoclikdjnjlcmefiofgjimgca),
clicking remove then installing it again.

Next, try clearing cookies for twitter. Click on [the lock](https://i.imgur.com/mrN3So1.png),
then click [cookies](https://i.imgur.com/ubaejpk.png). Now just click [remove](https://i.imgur.com/xck2mxL.png) NOT BLOCK for ALL OF THEM.
You'll have to log back in. That should fix most issues.

You can also try restarting chrome or your computer.
